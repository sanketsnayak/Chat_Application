# Simple Chat Application (MERN + Socket.io)

## Overview  
This is a real-time chat application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** and **Socket.io** for bidirectional communication. It enables users to send and receive messages instantly without page refresh.

## Features  
- Real-time messaging using **WebSockets**  
- Instant updates without reloading the page  
- Simple and responsive UI  
- Scalable backend with Node.js and Express  


## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: React  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express   
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io  

## How It Works  
1. Users open the chat application.  
2. The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection with the backend.  
3. Messages are sent and received in real-time using **Socket.io**.  
4. The backend handles message broadcasting to all connected users.  

## About Socket.io  
Socket.io is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, event-driven communication between clients and servers. It uses WebSockets as its primary transport but also provides fallback options for compatibility with older browsers.
